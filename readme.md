# The SiteNote Project - the best way to keep notes on the web
SiteNote is a collection of applications whose purpose is to make it easier to keep notes on the WWW. 
The core of this repo is NoteLad, which is a web platform and a chrome extension, that works together to do precisely this: help you keep track of things that you find on the internet. 

## How it works
You download the extension, sign in with google, then start navigating the web to find something to take notes about :) 

## Contact
Please reach out if you find aspects of the application that you would like to give feedback about.
