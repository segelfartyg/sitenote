# SiteNote - keeping notes on the web
SiteNote is a collection of applications whose purpose is to make it easier to keep notes on the internet. 

## Vision
The main goal of sitenote is to make it possible to easily open a chrome extension and take some notes. Afterwards, it should be easy to navigate to a website to organize the findings.

## Contact
Please reach out if you find aspects of the application that you would like to give feedback about. I want to make this as great as possible and all feedback is welcome :) 

## Technologies 
For backend Go is used, and frontend (the web app) is made in React TypeScript. The extension is made in vanilla JS.
